# Analog Bird SAO
This is an SAO I designed to share at the Open Source Hardware Conference 2024.

It is my attempt at making an analog circuit that mimics a bird call, inspired by Kelly Heaton's work: [https://www.kellyheatonstudio.com/](https://www.kellyheatonstudio.com/)

What is an SAO? Here's a Hackaday article about that: [https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/)
